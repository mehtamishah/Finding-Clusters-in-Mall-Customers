# Finding clusters to help the mall business look for growth opportunities
Built a model to identify clusters in mall-going customers. <br>

Used both Hierarchical and K-Means Clustering algorithms. Code for both algoriths can be found [here](https://github.com/mehtamishah/Finding-Clusters-in-Mall-Customers). <br>

Through both clustering algorithms I was able to find 5 clusters. 
1. Low income, low spending score
2. Low income, high spending score
3. Medium income, medium spending score
4. High income, low spending score
5. High income, high spending score

Future marketing strategies and campaigns can be customized for the high income, high spending score cluster of customers.
