# Project Identifying growth opportunities for the mall business
Built a model to identify clusters in mall-going customers. <br>

Used both Hierarchical and K-Means Clustering algorithms. Code for both algorithms can be found [here](https://github.com/mehtamishah/Finding-Clusters-in-Mall-Customers). <br>

For the K-Means clustering used the elbow method to identify the optimum number of clusters and for hierarchical clustering used the dendogram to identify the optimum number of clusters.

Clustering revealed 5 clusters. 
1. Low income, low spending score
2. Low income, high spending score
3. Medium income, medium spending score
4. High income, low spending score
5. High income, high spending score

Future marketing strategies and campaigns can be customized to meet the needs of the high income, high spending score cluster of customers.
